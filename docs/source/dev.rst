Making a release
----------------
To make a release, do the following:
1. Create a new branch and make changes.
2. Create a pull request once changes are complete. 
3. When the pull request is merged to the main branch, click *Create a new release* under Releases. 
4. Create/select a tag with the **Major.Minor.Patch** (Semantic Versioning) format, and a release title **Version tag_name**.
5. New release should automatically be deployed to pypi.
